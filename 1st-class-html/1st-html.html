<p>The <b>HyperText Markup Language or HTML</b> is the standard markup <small>language</small> for documents designed to
    be displayed
    in a web
    browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
    JavaScript.

    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
    web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
</p>

<p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
    visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and
    these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text
    elements are mentioned in the <i>1988 ISO technical report TR 9537</i> Techniques for using SGML, which describes
    the
    features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for
    the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands
    used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on
    elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and
    markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
